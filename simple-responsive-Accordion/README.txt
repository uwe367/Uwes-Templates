Simple Responsive Accordion for CP Register Tabs.
Move the CSS File into a directory you need and set the path in TMPL File,
for Example:
<!-- CSS: {TEMPLATE}accordion/accordion.css -->

Move the TMPL File to the Template Path for Register Tabs (template/inc_cntpart/tabs).
Create a new Contentpart Register Tabs and select jquery-accordion as Template.
Thats all.

For Images to open/close the Accordion have a look into the CSS File where they are used.
There you can set new Pathes and/or Directorys to them.
